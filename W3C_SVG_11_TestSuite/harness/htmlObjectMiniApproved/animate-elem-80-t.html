<p>The test has eight sub-tests, each of which consists of a brown
      shape being animated in some way with the animation starting two
      seconds after the document is loaded.  Gray shapes are used
      to indicate points along the animation.  The test passes if
      the brown shape in each of the sub-tests is animated correctly,
      according to the following descriptions:</p><ul>
        <li>In the two "type=rotate" sub-tests, the brown line is rotated
        clockwise about one of its end points for one complete revolution,
        and then immediately performs the reverse animation where it is
        rotated anti-clockwise for one complete revolution.  During the
        animation, whenever the other end point of the line coincides
        with one of the gray filled circles, the circle briefly glows yellow.</li>
        <li>In the "type=skewX" sub-test, the brown line continuously skewed.
        It starts off coinciding with the middle gray silhouette, and then
        over the course of the animation coincides with the left gray silhouette,
        the middle one, the right one and finally the middle one again.
        During the animation, whenever the brown line coincides with one of the gray silhouettes,
        the silhouette briefly glows yellow.</li>
        <li>In the "type=skewY" sub-test, the brown line continuously skewed.
        It starts off coinciding with the middle gray silhouette, and then
        over the course of the animation coincides with the top gray silhouette,
        the middle one, the bottom one and finally the middle one again.
        During the animation, whenever the brown line coincides with one of the gray silhouettes,
        the silhouette briefly glows yellow.</li>
        <li>In the two "type=translate" sub-tests, the brown circle is continuously
        translated.  It starts off coinciding with the left-most gray circle, and
        over the course of the animation coincides each of the other gray circles
        from left to right.  During the animation, whenever the brown circle coincides with one of the
        gray circles, the circle briefly glows yellow.</li>
        <li>In the two "type=scale" sub-tests, the brown circle is continuously
        scaled.  There are four concentric gray stroked circles indicating the
        sizes the brown circle will take during the animation, although they
        are only all visible at the end of the animation.  (Initially only the
        largest one is visible.)  The brown circle
        starts off with a size coinciding with the largest gray circle, and
        over the course of the animation coincides each of the other gray circles
        from outside in.  During the animation, whenever the brown circle coincides with one of the
        gray circles, the circle briefly glows yellow.</li>
