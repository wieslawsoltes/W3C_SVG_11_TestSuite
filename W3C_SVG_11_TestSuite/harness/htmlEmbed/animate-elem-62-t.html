<p>Run the test.  Observe the document for at least eight seconds.
      Then, click on the first red square in the "event base" row,

<p>The test passes if the following conditions are met:</p><ul>
        <li>In the first eight seconds of the document, the 10 squares
        in the left section of the test must become green at the time
        at the top of the column they are in.  For example, the square in
        the "offset" row must become green at 2s after the document has
        been loaded.</li>
        <li>Immediately once the red square in the "event base" row has been clicked,
        it must become green.  Two seconds after the click, the second square
        must become green.</li>
        <li>Immediately once "a" has been pressed on the keyboard,
        the first square in the "accessKey()" row must become green.
        Two seconds after the keypress, the second square must become green.</li>
        <li>No other changes occur in the document.</li>

    Test Description
  </h2>
  <div>
<p>
        This test performs basic test on the end attribute,
        assuming support for the &lt;set&gt; element and setting the
        fill attribute on a &lt;rect&gt; element.
      </p><p>
        The test validates the various possibilities for the end attribute
        value: no specified value, offset value, event base value, sync base
        value, indefinite value, repeat value, accessKey value and wallclock.
      </p><p>
        There are one or several &lt;set&gt; elements for each of the possible end
        values. For each test, the &lt;set&gt; element(s) has (or have) an indefinite
        duration and no other timing attribute specified other than end
        and dur.
      </p><p>
        There are two sets of vertical markers which help check that the test
        is handled properly by the user agent. The first set, on the left, shows
        markers from 0s to 8s, where the times are offset from the document's load time.
        The rectangles in that area should turn green at the time corresponding
        to the column they are in. From example, the first rectangle (going left to right)
        on the "sync base" line should turn green 2 seconds after the document's load.
        The second set of time vertical markers shows offset from a particular event.
        For example, for the event base, the markers show an offset to the time
        the first event base rectangle (the left-most one) is clicked on. For the
        accessKey line, the times show offsets from the time the 'a' key is pressed
        and the document has focus.
      </p><p>
        The first &lt;set&gt; has no end attribute and an indefinite duration.
        Since there are no constraints on the active duration (no end attribute) the
        active duration is the same as the simple duration (indefinite). This
        means that the animation begins at 0s and has an indefinite end time.
      </p><p>
        The second &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to '2s'. So its
        target rectangle should turn green two seconds after the document is
        loaded.
      </p><p>
        The third &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to an event base
        value 'click'. The user has to click on the left-most target red rectangle
        to make the &lt;set&gt; target turn green. There are two rectangles
        with associated &lt;set&gt; elements. The left most ones has a simple
        value (no offset) and the second one is offset from the event time by 2 seconds.
      </p><p>
        The fourth &lt;set&gt; elements have their end attributes set to a sync base
        value. The first two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base
        end. The left-most one has no offset and the following one has a 2 seconds offset.
        The last two rectangles have &lt;set&gt; elements synchronized on their sync base end.
        The first one (i.e., the third from left to right on that line), has a 2 seconds
        negative offset. The second one (i.e., the last one on the line) has no offset and should
        end at the time its sync base ends.
      </p><p>
        The fifth &lt;set&gt; has its end attribute set to indefinite and
        should not turn red and stay green.
      </p><p>
        The sixth &lt;set&gt;s have their end attributes have their end attributes
        based on the repeat() function. The repeat they are synchronized on happens
        at 3s. The first &lt;set&gt;, which has no offset, should end at 3s. The
        second &lt;set&gt;, which has a 2 seconds offset, should start at 5s.
      </p><p>
        The seventh &lt;set&gt;s have their end attributes set to 'accessKey(a)'.
        The first one has no offset and should become active (and turn the rectangle
        green), as soon as the key 'a' is pressed in the user agent. The second &lt;set&gt;
        has a 2s offset and should become active 2 seconds after the 'a' key is pressed in
        the user agent.
      </p><p>
        The eight's &lt;set&gt; target has its end attribute set to
        'wallclock()'. The result depends on the presentation time.
        If the document is viewed completely before 2200-06-10T12:34:56Z,
        the rectangle has to be always green. begin is not explicitely set, therefore
        it is zero, dur is indefinite and end is in the future.
        If the document is viewed completely after 2200-06-10T12:34:56Z, the only end
        value is before the implicitely given only begin value and therefore the set
        does not start, the rectangle remains red. If the document is viewed in a time interval started before
        2200-06-10T12:34:56Z and ended after this date, the rectangle will start green at the beginning, change to red at
        2200-06-10T12:34:56Z and will remain red until the end of presentation.
